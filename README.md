# Using Tweepy to collect Twitter Data

## About
This repository provides code to collect tweets from user timelines for a given period of time using the Python library [Tweepy](https://docs.tweepy.org/en/stable/index.html). The program uses the standard twitter API 1.1 that comes with some [some rate limits.](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/rate-limits#:~:text=Standard%20API%20v1.&text=You%20can%20only%20post%20300,during%20a%203%20hour%20period.)


## Installation
In case you need help in setting up the python and tweepy environment, I recommend you to follow [my step-by-step guide](https://www.alexanderlammers.net/2018/06/05/tweepy-economic-research/). Otherwise, just download this repository and provide a list of firm handles for which you want to collect the tweets in the file `firmhandles.txt`.
